# Script Purpose:
""""
This script will process all extraction input datasets into a binary extraction mask.
Extraction datasets may be used as one condition in determining drainage.
Extraction datasets will be used in disaggregating emission factors in drained organic soils.
Desired output: 10x10 degree tiles at 30 meter resolution. WGS 1984 projection. Aligned to Peat rasters.

1. Set up the Environment
   - Import necessary libraries (e.g., rasterio, geopandas, numpy, boto3 for S3 interaction).
   - Configure AWS S3 credentials if needed.

2. Read Peat Tile Characteristics
   - Load the peat index shapefile to get the bounding boxes of the 10x10 degree tiles.
   - Define the standard characteristics (e.g., resolution, projection) from the peat tiles.

3. List Input Datasets
   - List all input datasets from the specified S3 input directory.
   - Ensure datasets are accessible and list them in a structured manner.

4. Process Each Input Dataset
   - Loop through each input dataset and perform the following steps:

     a. Read Input Data
        - Load the dataset using appropriate methods based on the data format (e.g., rasterio for GeoTIFF, pandas for CSV).

     b. Reproject to WGS 1984
        - If the dataset is not in WGS 1984, reproject it to the standard projection.

     c. Resample to 30 Meter Resolution
        - Resample the dataset to the 30-meter resolution using appropriate resampling techniques.

     d. Align to Peat Tiles
        - Align the dataset to the peat tile grid. Ensure the alignment matches the peat rasters in terms of resolution and tile boundaries.

     e. Create Binary Extraction Mask
        - Convert the dataset into a binary extraction mask where 1 represents extraction presence and 0 represents absence.

5. Save Processed Data
   - For each processed dataset, save the binary extraction mask as a new raster file in the specified output directory on S3.

6. Logging and Error Handling
   - Implement logging to track the progress of the script and any errors encountered.
   - Ensure that any errors are logged with sufficient detail for troubleshooting.

7. Verification and Quality Check
   - Verify the output tiles by checking a few samples visually or using statistical methods to ensure the processing steps are correct.
